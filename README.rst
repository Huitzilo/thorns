Description
-----------


With *thorns* you can analyze and display `spike trains`_ generated by
neurons.  It can be useful for both experimental and simulation data
using Python.  For example, you can easily calculate peristimulus time
histogram (PSTH), interspike time histogram (ISIH), vector strength
(VS), entrainment and visualize action potentials with raster plot.

I developed the package during my PhD in the group of `Werner
Hemmert`_ at the TUM.  It is oriented towards auditory research, but
it could be easily extended.

Usage
-----

Initialize and load spike trains::

  import thorns as th
  from thorns.datasets import load_anf_zilany2014

  spike_trains = load_anf_zilany2014()


Calculate vector strength::

  th.vector_strength(spike_trains, freq=1000)


Raster plot::

  th.plot_raster(spike_trains)
  th.show()
